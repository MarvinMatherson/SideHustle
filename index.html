		<p>Hello guys! Welcome to our website. Before I start, I want to thank my dear friend in far Great Britain, Marvin who put a lot of effort making this page functional.<br><br>

My name is Dolores and let me tell you a story of how it all started.<br><br>

I recently finished high school and I didn’t make a choice to leave my country as my other friends did. And that is like  tradition, considering the situation here in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But, we’ll talk about it another time.
My wish is to start at the faculty of medicine at a university that is 310 km far from my home town. I started preparing for the entrance exam  which depends if I will get accepted.To fulfill my time I started reading and that wasn’t enough.Knowing that Marvin actively codes, I became curious.
All this exposure, coding became interesting, and you start to imagine that you work for some high-tech hack group. When I acknowledged his work I thought to myself: “I want to do that too”, but as a hobby. (I’m staying loyal to my medicine, sorry Marv).<br> <br>

First we started on a website called Repl.it, where I learned the basics. I continued educating myself with the help of online courses. After many mistakes, with my lack of knowledge and his patience we made our first website. To be honest, it didn't look good, but I was really proud. After that, I didn’t participate in any projects and distanced myself from coding. I started studying and focusing more on my faculty.
I didn't realize how hard coding is up until now. I thought it’s gonna be easy, but turned out to be a bit more challenging! Over time, the things I knew about I forgot and couldn't quite remember. I reconciled with that fact...
It was such a good and funny journey that helped me fall in love in a special way with coding. And even with the little of what I know, I put coding as an additional option if I don't make it in medicine. <br> <br>

Next few months I dedicated my time to physics, chemistry and biology preparing for that important exam, until Marvin came across with an idea of us collaborating again. I couldn’t say no to my friend, so I accepted that offer.I wanted to make him happy.
Marvin introduced to me one beautiful website, Moqups where you can design your page before coding it. He already started working on it. And let me tell you one thing, as a newbie I totally enjoyed it. He asked me to help him with the color scheme, because he knew I have a good taste in designing.And of course, I immediately went to work, trying to figure out the best color combination. We ran into a few issues, which was expected. I was there working with him for a couple of more days, helping as much I could. But then unfortunately I left due to some private reasons. Despite my absence Marvin stayed and continued working. I remember how much he raged because of some silly things which he was able to fix in the end!!!<br> <br>

So now when I’m finishing this I just want to say thank you Marvin. You get the most credit for all of this.
Marvin spent a lot of his precious time on this, beside his job and college. I’m glad we became a small, but effective duo.<br> <br>

Thank you too, my dear visitors. We are still at the beginning. There's a lot to do and add, but new ideas are coming up every day. Stay tuned!

Love, MaD
